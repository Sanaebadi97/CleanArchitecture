# CleanArchitecture :heart_eyes: :v:

Here’s a brief definition of some terms from the images above to help you get more familiar with this approach::relaxed:

**Entities** are enterprise-wide business rules that encapsulate the most general business rules and also contain Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). When something external changes, these rules are the least likely to change.


**Use cases** are also called interactors and stand for application-specific business rules of the software. This layer is isolated from changes to the database, common frameworks, and the UI.


**Interface adapters** convert data from a convenient format for entities and use cases to a format applicable to databases and the web, for example. This layer includes Presenters from MVP, ViewModel from MVVM, and Gateways (also known as Repositories).


**Frameworks and drivers** are the outermost layer, which consists of the web framework, database, UI, HTTP client, and so on.

As you can see in the image, an Android application with Clean Architecture gathers the layers into three modules:

**Presentation**, which includes the UI, Presenter, and ViewModels

**Domain**, which includes Entities and Interactors

**Data**, which includes Databases and Rest clients

----

***Here’s a short list of technologies used in this example:*** :sunglasses:

**Kotlin** ‒ A statically typed programming language for modern multi-platform applications; Google rates Kotlin a first-class language for writing Android apps

**Dagger 2** ‒ A fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android

**RxJava 2** ‒ Reactive Extensions for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) – a library for composing asynchronous and event-based 
programs using observable sequences for the JVM

**Retrofit 2** ‒ A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java

--
Along with the Clean Architecture approach, the following Android architecture components will also be used in the application:

**Room** ‒ Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite

**ViewModel** ‒ Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a life cycle-conscious way

**LiveData** ‒ An observable data holder class that, unlike a regular observable, is life cycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components such as activities, fragments, and services

**Paging Library** ‒ Makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app’s RecyclerView
